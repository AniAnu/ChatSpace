# Chatspace
Multi User Chat Application using NodeJS and Express Framework using NoSQL MongoDB. The application is deployed in Heroku. You can see the demo here at chat-space-app.herokuapp.com

Understanding in development and production environments. Look through app/config => development.json and index.js 
External Softwares 
1) Used MongoDb as a Service (MongoLabs-now Mlabs)
2) Used monitoring tools on Heroku such as PaperTrail
3) Used an external API called Cloudinary (Image management)
4) Socket.io (Real time event based communication)


For Social Authentication - I have used PassportJs , a really good middleware for Node.js (http://passportjs.org/)
